PPR characteristics:
Triple layer
Outer diameter: 25.6 mm
Inner diameter: 17.6 mm
Wall thickness: 4 mm

PPR #3 is a tube that I gradually cut small increments from until I fell on 12-TET frequencies, at which point I measured the length and 9 harmonics.

Used Spectroid on Android to obtain the frequency readings in Hz.
FFT size: 4096
Sampling rate: 96000 Hz
Window: Hamming
Decimations: 9 (0.18 Hz / bin)
